Projects in ML, DL, and RL
ML Project
Explanation: This project involves building a predictive model using scikit-learn. It focuses on a classification task where various algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM) are compared. The dataset is preprocessed, and features are engineered to improve model performance.
DL Project
This project utilizes TensorFlow to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. It involves data augmentation, model architecture design, and performance tuning using techniques like dropout and batch normalization.
RL Project
Explanation: This project implements a reinforcement learning algorithm using OpenAI Gym and Stable Baselines. The focus is on training an agent to solve a control problem using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). It includes environment setup, reward function design, and policy optimization.
